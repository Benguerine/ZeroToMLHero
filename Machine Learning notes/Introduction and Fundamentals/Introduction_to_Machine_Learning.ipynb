|\n","|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|\n","| **📘 Supervised Learning** | You teach the model with **labeled examples** — like a student learning from a teacher with an answer key. | 📝 **Inputs** → 🤖 **Model** → 🎯 **Prediction** → ✅❌ Compare with **Correct Answer** → 🔄 **Adjust** | 🏠 Predicting house prices from size, location, and age. |\n","| **🧩 Unsupervised Learning** | The model **finds patterns** in unlabeled data — like solving a puzzle without the picture on the box. | 📝 **Inputs** → 🤖 **Model** → 🔍 **Patterns / Clusters** | 🛍 Grouping customers by shopping habits. |\n","| **🔄 Semi-supervised Learning** | A mix of **a few labeled** and **many unlabeled** examples — like learning with a few examples and figuring out the rest yourself. | 📄 **Few Labeled Data** + 📄📄📄 **Lots of Unlabeled Data** → 🤖 → 🎯 **Predictions** | 🩺 Detecting diseases from medical scans when only some are labeled. |\n","| **🎮 Reinforcement Learning (RL)** | An **agent**
